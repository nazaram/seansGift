{"name":"Sean's Present. ","tagline":"shitcrao","body":"## Welcome to Your Present\r\n\r\nSolve to Get Your Password. \r\n\r\n### Code 0: \r\nHow you got here. \r\n\r\n### Code 1: \r\nSteph, a.k.a. _____(k)____. (k)'s Paralyzer's Track 7 = _____(zz)____. (zz)'s enemy --> ____(1)____ |____(2)_____ --> (2) is played by ____(I)_____in movie with too many space sex scenes. (I)'s First Name: ______(a)______. \"(a)'s favorite band ____(b1)_____. (b1) + 1 + \"boy\" = ____(y)____. (y) doesn't like this artist ____(G)____ by himself, but still likes the band this artist leads ____(k1)_____ , \"all according to TwitchChat\". (G)'s favorite vegetable/fan is ____(i)____. (i)'s color + comedian = ____(z)____. Some say ____(x)____ looks like (z), but I think (z) tries to be just like (x) cause (x) is the ____(CODE 0)____-est.  \r\n\r\n### Code 2: (google + google-translate is probably needed for this) \r\nLine ____(o)____, word # ____(c)____ on Mareegocha. o = Track Listing # of: (Vince Cartilidge - Sail On Silvergirl)). c= (NoNoNo! Main Project's Stock on 7.24.2015 - 118.5). ____(c)____, the worst is yet to ____(d)_____. \r\n\r\n### Code 3: \r\nGo Back and Decipher the Track. (Hint: Letters.)\r\n\r\n### Once you have codes 1, 2, and 3 you can solve the following sentences for your gift. \r\n\r\n(X) wishes he had as good as taste as (a) and a (k). It's a shame that he will never understand the true brilliance of (b1). Maybe if (x) owned some ____(u)'s_____ of (b1) among the shitton of (u)'s that he already owned, then he would understand the true brilliance of (b1). Perhaps he would even ____(P1)_____ this (b1)'s (u) on his wall. \r\n\r\n(K) would naturally disagree with (a) and think that (x) should ____(P1)_____ the band (k1)'s _____(u)_____ on his Wall.   \r\n\r\nAram would disagree and thinks that he should instead ____(P1)___ (i)s all over his room. He still feels bad about googling but not Draking the previous poster that previously ____(P1)___-ed on his wall. But seriously, how cool would it be if Sean could actually ___(P1)____ his ___(u)___'s. \r\n\r\nMaybe (x) will one day be good enough to have his own Platinum (u) or boxes,  (P1)'ed on his wall. He'd probably need to practice some more in order to get up there though, or he could just make some EDM. If he chooses the more noble route, he'd probably need to practice in class. He already uses his writing utencils _____(pncl)____ as  a _____(ds)_____, why not turn his ____(pncl)____ into a ___(ds)___, a.k.a ___(pd)___ so he can always practice. \r\n\r\n## Your Gift: \r\n###gift 1: (u) + (P1)\r\n\r\n###gift 2: (pd) \r\n\r\nKnow that I was (c)'ing and laughing while you were solving this. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
