(y) doesn't like this artist ____(G)____ by himself, but still likes the band this artist leads ____(k1)_____ , "all according to TwitchChat". (G)'s favorite vegetable/fan is ____(i)____. (i)'s color + comedian = ____(z)____. Some say ____(x)____ looks like (z), but I think (z) tries to be just like (x) cause (x) is the ____(CODE 0)____-est.  </p>

<p>(X) wishes he had as good as taste as (a) and a (k). It's a shame that he will never understand the true brilliance of (b1). Maybe if (x) owned some ____(u)'s_____ of (b1) among the shitton of (u)'s that he already owned, then he would understand the true brilliance of (b1). Perhaps he would even ____(P1)_____ this (b1)'s (u) on his wall. </p>

<p>(K) would naturally disagree with (a) and think that (x) should ____(P1)_____ the band (k1)'s _____(u)_____ on his Wall.   </p>

<p>Aram would disagree and thinks that he should instead ____(P1)___ (i)s all over his room. He still feels bad about googling but not Draking the previous poster that previously ____(P1)<em>__-ed on his wall. But seriously, how cool would it be if Sean could actually __</em>(P1)____ his <strong><em>(u)</em></strong>'s. </p>

<p>Maybe (x) will one day be good enough to have his own Platinum (u) or boxes,  (P1)'ed on his wall. He'd probably need to practice some more in order to get up there though, or he could just make some EDM. If he chooses the more noble route, he'd probably need to practice in class. He already uses his writing utencils _____(pncl)____ as  a _____(ds)_____, why not turn his ____(pncl)____ into a <strong><em>(ds)</em></strong>, a.k.a <strong><em>(pd)</em></strong> so he can always practice. </p>
